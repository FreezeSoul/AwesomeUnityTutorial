This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an educational project demonstrating AI-driven game development for a 2D pixel-style ARPG game set in a multi-universe universe combining Song Dynasty history, martial arts, and mythology. The project documents the complete process of using AI tools to create a game from concept to implementation.

## Key Game Design Concepts

### Core Game Features
- **Genre**: 2D pixel-style ARPG
- **Setting**: Multi-universe with Song Dynasty history, martial arts, and mythology
- **Player Role**: "Outsider" from modern world,不受天命、因果、信仰束缚
- **Core Mechanics**: Companion system, army management, faith-based power system
- **Art Style**: 16-bit pixel art with top-down view

### AI Tool Integration
The project demonstrates systematic use of AI tools throughout development:
- **Game Design**: LLMs for mechanics design and documentation
- **Asset Generation**: AI image generation for pixel art resources
- **Code Development**: AI coding assistants for Unity development
- **Testing & Optimization**: AI-assisted code review and performance optimization

## Development Workflow

### Phase-Based Development
1. **Game Design & Planning** - AI-assisted game mechanics and GDD creation
2. **Asset Preparation** - AI-generated pixel art, characters, environments
3. **Project Setup** - Unity configuration with AI assistance
4. **Core Systems** - Character, combat, and progression systems
5. **Level Design** - Procedural generation with AI-driven content
6. **Game Polish** - Audio, UI, effects, and balance
7. **Testing & Optimization** - AI-assisted testing and performance tuning
8. **Release Preparation** - Build, documentation, and marketing materials

### AI Tool Usage Patterns
- **Documentation Generation**: Use structured prompts with role definitions
- **Asset Creation**: Combine concept generation with pixel art processing
- **Code Development**: Leverage AI coding assistants with Unity integration
- **Quality Control**: AI-assisted review and optimization workflows

## Working with This Project

### When Adding New Content
1. Follow the established naming convention: `ep##-[description].md`
2. Use the AI prompt templates found in existing documentation
3. Maintain consistency with the multi-universe, Song Dynasty theme
4. Include practical AI tool usage examples

### When Modifying Game Design
1. Reference the master GDD (`ep07-游戏设计总文档GDD.md`)
2. Update corresponding detailed design documents in `ep07-datas/`
3. Ensure consistency across all related systems
4. Document AI tool usage for any new features

### When Creating Assets
1. Follow the asset structure in `ASD/` directory
2. Use the pixel art generation prompts and templates
3. Maintain 16-bit style consistency
4. Include AI tool usage documentation

## File Naming Conventions
- Episodes: `ep##-[description].md`
- Game docs: `ep07-datas/ep07-[number]-[topic].md`
- Assets: `ASD/[number]-[type]设计文档.md`

## AI Prompt Engineering
The project uses structured prompts with:
- **Role Definition**: Clear professional role specification
- **Background Context**: Project type, scale, and constraints
- **Output Requirements**: Format, depth, and quality standards
- **Iterative Process**: Multi-stage generation and refinement

## Important Notes
- This is a documentation-focused project, not a codebase
- All content is in Chinese language
- Focus is on educational demonstration of AI tools in game development
- No actual Unity game code or assets are currently present
